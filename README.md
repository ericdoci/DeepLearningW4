#Introduction

In this Kaggle Mini-Project we are looking at Natural Language processing with Disaster Tweets.

The Goal is to build a NLP classifier, a branch of AI that enables computers to interpret and generate human language, that is able to automatically flag real world disaster Tweets. The model was trained and evaluated on a hand labeled dataset of 7,613 tweets, demonstrating robust separation of genuine emergencies from metaphorical or off topic posts.
